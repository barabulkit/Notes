**echo "something" > file.txt** - creates file.txt if not existed and print "something" to it (without quotes), overrides previous content if file already existed
**echo "something" >> file.txt** - the same as above but don't override, instead it append
**touch file.txt** - creates empty file.txt
**cat file.txt** - prints file.txt content
