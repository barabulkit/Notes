ipv4 example - 192.168.57.139 (decimal notation)
ipv6 example - FE80 :: 20C :: 29FF :: FE0A :: 4205 (hexadecimal notation)

# IPv4 reprezentation
each ipv4 is 32 bits
so `192.168.57.139` is equal to `1100 0000.1010 1000.0011 1001.1000 1011`

# IPv4 Problem
since its 32 bits there is only $2^{32}$ possible addresses, and it is not enough
its solved with ipv6 and **NAT**

# NAT 
**NAT** - Network Address Translation
**NAT** gives to devices in local network special private IPs
